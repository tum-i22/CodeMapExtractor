# CodeMapExtractor

## About 
CodeMapExtractor is a simple tool to extract graph from dgml file. dgml is the file extension of CodeMap generated by Visual Studio. CodeMapExtractor is capable of extracting function call graph beyond classes and namespace provided that a correct dgml file is given. 

## For Further Development
CodeMapExtractor store the call graph of whole project as a adjacency matrix and a networkx object. You can do any experiment on the adjacency matrix. networkx is rich in graph algorithm, most of the famous graph algorithm like BFS, DFS, Floyd-Warshall, Dijkstra etc algorithm can be invoked with a single line change.
