# CodeMapExtractor

## About 
CodeMapExtractor is a simple tool to extract graph from dgml file. dgml is the file extension of CodeMap generated by Visual Studio which is a special kind of XML. CodeMapExtractor is capable of extracting function call graph beyond classes and namespace provided that a correct dgml file is given. 

## For Further Development
CodeMapExtractor stores the call graph of whole project as a adjacency matrix and a networkx object. You can do any experiment on the adjacency matrix. networkx is rich in graph algorithm, most of the famous graph algorithm like BFS, DFS, Floyd-Warshall, Dijkstra etc algorithm can be invoked with a single line change.
